#summary How to install Vektornye from source.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Download =
In order to download Vektornye, you will need a Subversion client.

Links to the SVN repository can be found on the Source page of this site.

= Server =
Your server must be configured to serve files with the correct MIME type:
{{{Content-Type: image/svg+xml}}}

Optionally, you may set your server to use 'index.svg' as an index file.

= Installation =
Sylvester is a matrix math library for JavaScript, and is important for doing on-the-fly transformations of coordinates in SVG path data. It can be found here: http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/

Edit the second script dependency in index.svg to point to Sylvester.

Point your browser to the file's location, and load it on up.

= Compatibility =
For the time being, only Mozilla Firefox 3 is supported. This is because the game will only be distributed using the Mozilla Prism site-specific browser.
