#summary Tasks and notes.

= Tasks =
  * Block selection & duplication
  * Save block positions as voxels within the client
  * Send voxels to the server, retrieve & render again
  * Rotate voxel data with Sylvester
  * Component consolidation; building an object (serverside) from voxels that will use an algorithm to build four isometric views of the voxel data as one consolidated component, while retaining component shading and colors
