  # _Make sure a new block isn't given if a block that's already placed is moved_
  # _Fix or remove stack-moving_
  # _Reposition grid on window resize-- This has problems, so this feature is deprecated for simplicity's sake. An alert appears in the Event Log when the window is resized._
  # _Solve the z-index issue; due to the painters algorithm used by SVG, we need to redraw the adjacent node_
  # _Replace gradients with a diagonal GUI, alongside the grid_
  # _Colored blocks on the GUI, light & dark of each (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) + (White, Light Gray, Dark Gray, Black)_
  # _Block removal & garbage collection_
  # _Improve debug function to scroll and display status messages throughout different functions of the client-- an event log._
  # *Clean up code to better allow extension and future improvement, and add more comments.*
  # *Keep blocks from occupying the same space, either on the grid or when stacked*
  # *Highlight blocks when hovered over, Outline block when another block is over it*
  # *Stacking on the bottom of a stack of blocks places the block inbetween the stack*
